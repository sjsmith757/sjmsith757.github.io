abstract: "As a dominant mode of jet variability on sub-seasonal timescales, the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) provides a window into how the atmosphere can produce internal oscillations on longer-than-synoptic timescales. However, because recent generations of Earth system models do not properly simulate SAM’s timescales, previous work has sought to identify the determinants of SAM’s behavior.  While SAM’s existence can be explained by dry, purely barotropic theories, the timescale for its persistence and propagation is set by a lagged interaction between barotropic and baroclinic mechanisms, making the exact physical mechanisms difficult to identify. By analyzing the eddy flux convergence budget in the MERRA2 reanalysis, we contend that diabatic processes, such as condensation and radiative heating, are the main contributors to SAM persistence in the non-propagating regime. In the propagating regime, baroclinic processes are the dominant source of persistence and strong drivers of propagation. These diabatic feedbacks on SAM are consistent with modulation of the storm track latitude by SAM, altering the emission temperature and cloud cover over individual waves. Therefore, we suggest that any attempts to improve SAM representation in models should strongly consider the influence of storm track location, as well as cloud and moisture parameterizations."
