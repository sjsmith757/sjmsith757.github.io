I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences](https://earth.indiana.edu) at [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu) in [Bloomington, Indiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana) in the [Staten lab](https://pwstaten.pages.iu.edu/).

My research tries to understand the role of the large-scale atmospheric circulation in the climate system, with a focus on the jet stream. I am particularly interested in [how the jet stream influences extremes in the water cycle](https://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0780.1), as well as why the jet's position fluctuates on monthly-to-yearly timescales.

I'm also a co-developer for the [PyTropD library](https://github.com/tropd/pytropd/) for identifying major features in the atmospheric circulation and comparing metrics of tropical widening. In my free time, I enjoy reading, cycling, training Pok&#x00E9;mon, and walking [my dog](/images/remi.jpg).
